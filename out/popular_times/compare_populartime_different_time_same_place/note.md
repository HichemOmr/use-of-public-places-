## Observing Popular Times Changes Over Different Time Periods

To investigate whether the popular times data for a place changes if we harvest it at different times, I conducted an experiment. Google API documentation states that it retrieves the most recent data. To test this, I harvested data for the same place at two different times.

### Place ID
- **Place ID**: ChIJSRAEZNVOlUcRV_BppDN4Kmg

### Data Files
- **popular_times_recent.xlsx**: Data harvested on 13/08
- **popular_times_recent_new.xlsx**: Data harvested on 28/08

### Conclusion
The data collected at the two different times shows variation, indicating that the popular times data changes over time as expected.
