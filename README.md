# Database-for-SusDens

## Overview
The **Database-for-SusDens** project is designed to create and manage a SQLite database based on an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) using Python in a Jupyter notebook. This repository includes scripts for database operations, Google API integration for retrieving popular time data, and guidance for extending or modifying the database.

## Features

### Database Creation and Management:
- Create and manage a SQLite database using Python and the `sqlite3` library in Jupyter notebooks.
- Includes scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and adding new columns.

### Google API Integration:
- Retrieve popular time data using the Google API.
- Includes a Jupyter notebook with a complete script and a tutorial for setup.

## Project Structure

- **src/popular_times.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook for retrieving popular time data using the Google API. Refer to this notebook for implementation details.

- **Extracting_PopularTime_Tutorial.md**: A detailed tutorial guiding you through the setup and use of the script for extracting popular time data.

- **src/Coding-for-Database.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that provides scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and adding new columns to the SQLite database.

- **Python SQLite Database Tutorial.md**: A tutorial that provides guidance on how to use the scripts for database operations.
